# Personal Blog - Technical Specifications

## Project Overview

A modern personal blog built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, featuring a clean architecture for content management and SEO-friendly routing.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React 19.1.1** - Frontend framework for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **React Router DOM 7.8.2** - Client-side routing
- **pnpm** - Package manager for efficient dependency management

### Rationale
- **React 19.1.1**: Latest stable version with improved performance and developer experience
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, better IDE support, and catches errors at compile time
- **Vite**: Faster development server and build times compared to traditional bundlers
- **React Router DOM**: Industry standard for React routing with excellent TypeScript support
- **pnpm**: More efficient disk usage and faster installs compared to npm

### Routing Structure

| Route | Component | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `/` | HomePage | Landing page with welcome message and recent posts |
| `/posts` | PostsPage | List of all blog posts with excerpts |
| `/posts/:slug` | PostDetailPage | Individual post content |

**Rationale**: Simple, SEO-friendly URL structure that's easy to understand and navigate.

## Content Management Architecture

### Individual Post Files Approach

**Decision**: Each blog post is a separate `.tsx` file in `src/pages/posts/`

**Structure**:
```typescript
interface PostProps {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  content: React.ReactNode;
}

function PostName(): PostProps {
  return {
    title: 'Post Title',
    date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
    content: (
      <div>
        {/* Rich React content */}
      </div>
    )
  };
}

export default PostName;
```

**Rationale**:
- **Maintainability**: Each post is isolated, making it easy to edit individual content
- **Rich Content**: Posts can include React components, not just markdown or plain text
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures consistent post structure
- **Performance**: Dynamic imports allow for code splitting and on-demand loading
- **Developer Experience**: Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for post content
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new posts without modifying existing code

### Dynamic Loading System

**PostDetailPage Implementation**:
- Uses dynamic imports: `import(\`./posts/${slug}.tsx\`)`
- Async loading with proper error handling
- Loading states and fallbacks for better UX

**PostsPage Implementation**:
- Loads metadata from all post files
- Generates post summaries automatically
- Sorts posts by date (newest first)

**Rationale**: Provides flexibility while maintaining performance through code splitting.

## Styling Architecture

### CSS Approach
- **Global CSS** in `App.css` for layout and common styles
- **Component-specific** classes with semantic naming
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

**Rationale**: Simple CSS approach suitable for a personal blog, avoiding complexity of CSS-in-JS for this scale.

## Development Workflow

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Vite provides instant updates during development
- Changes to post files are reflected immediately
- TypeScript compilation happens in real-time

### Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Interface definitions for all data structures
- Compile-time error checking

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
- Each post is a separate chunk, loaded on-demand
- React Router handles route-based code splitting
- Reduces initial bundle size

### SEO Optimization
- Clean, semantic URLs (`/posts/post-slug`)
- Proper HTML structure with semantic elements
- Meta tags can be easily added per post

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Metadata Management**: Add frontmatter-style metadata to posts
2. **Search Functionality**: Implement client-side search across posts
3. **Categories/Tags**: Add taxonomy system for content organization
4. **RSS Feed**: Generate RSS feed from post metadata
5. **Static Generation**: Consider Next.js for SSG if SEO becomes critical
6. **CMS Integration**: Headless CMS integration for non-technical content editing

### Scalability Notes
- Current architecture supports up to ~100 posts efficiently
- For larger scale, consider:
  - Build-time post indexing
  - Server-side rendering
  - Database-backed content management

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

## Adding New Posts

1. Create new `.tsx` file in `src/pages/posts/`
2. Follow the established `PostProps` interface
3. Add slug to the `postSlugs` array in `PostsPage.tsx`
4. File naming convention: `kebab-case.tsx`
