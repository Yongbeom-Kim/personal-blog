        <p>Modern web development has evolved significantly over the years. Today's web applications are more interactive, performant, and user-friendly than ever before.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Technologies</h2>
        <p>Some of the key technologies driving modern web development include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>React, Vue, or Angular for frontend frameworks</li>
          <li>TypeScript for type safety</li>
          <li>Modern build tools like Vite or Webpack</li>
          <li>CSS-in-JS or modern CSS frameworks</li>
          <li>State management libraries like Redux or Zustand</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Development Best Practices</h2>
        <p>When building modern web applications, consider these best practices:</p>
        
        <h3>Component-Based Architecture</h3>
        <p>Break your UI into reusable components that are easy to test and maintain.</p>
        
        <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
        <p>Use techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization to improve performance.</p>
        
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Ensure your applications are accessible to all users by following WCAG guidelines.</p>
        
        <h2>Tools and Workflow</h2>
        <p>Modern development workflows typically include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Version control with Git</li>
          <li>Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)</li>
          <li>Continuous integration and deployment</li>
          <li>Code formatting and linting</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These tools help developers build scalable and maintainable applications efficiently.</p>
