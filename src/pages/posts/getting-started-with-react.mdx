React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of React development.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Getting Started

To get started with React, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Then you can create a new React application using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will create a new React application and start the development server.

## Your First Component

Components are the building blocks of React applications. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

This component accepts a single "props" object argument with data and returns a React element.
