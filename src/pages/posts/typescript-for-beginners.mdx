TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which can help catch errors early and improve code quality.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several benefits over plain JavaScript:

- Static type checking catches errors at compile time
- Better IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring
- Improved code documentation through type annotations
- Easier maintenance of large codebases
- Enhanced developer productivity

## Basic Types

TypeScript includes several basic types:

```typescript
// Basic types
let isDone: boolean = false;
let decimal: number = 6;
let color: string = "blue";
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

// Function with types
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces define the shape of objects:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email?: string; // Optional property
}

function createUser(user: User): void {
  console.log(`Creating user: ${user.name}`);
}
```

## Getting Started

To start using TypeScript in your project:

```bash
# Install TypeScript globally
npm install -g typescript

# Create a TypeScript config file
tsc --init

# Compile TypeScript files
tsc filename.ts
```

Getting started with TypeScript is easy - you can gradually adopt it in existing JavaScript projects by simply renaming .js files to .ts and adding type annotations incrementally.
