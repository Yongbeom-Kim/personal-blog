Modern web development has evolved significantly over the years. Today's web applications are more interactive, performant, and user-friendly than ever before.

## Key Technologies

Some of the key technologies driving modern web development include:

- React, Vue, or Angular for frontend frameworks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern build tools like Vite or Webpack
- CSS-in-JS or modern CSS frameworks
- State management libraries like Redux or Zustand

## Development Best Practices

When building modern web applications, consider these best practices:

### Component-Based Architecture

Break your UI into reusable components that are easy to test and maintain.

### Performance Optimization

Use techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization to improve performance.

### Accessibility

Ensure your applications are accessible to all users by following WCAG guidelines.

## Tools and Workflow

Modern development workflows typically include:

- Version control with Git
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Code formatting and linting

These tools help developers build scalable and maintainable applications efficiently.
