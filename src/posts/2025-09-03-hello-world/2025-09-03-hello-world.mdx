I told myself to start a blog many many times, but it was really only after a friend Karisse started her [own](https://karissekhoo.dev) that I truly found the motivation to build my own little corner of the internet.

I intend this to be both a place to share cool things, and a cool project in and as of itself.

## About this Blog

When it comes to software, I'm more of a do-it-myself kinda guy. I'm here to write code, not to play dependency lego. 

For this reason, I'm starting _this_ project with a minimalistic tech stack. I understand that this probably isn't the way most developers would go about hosting blogs, but it's just so much more interesting writing everything by yourself. 

I do feel that fancy tools like Next.js and Astro that seem to hide everything away in a veneer of "abstraction".

### The Current Stack

This blog is a simple React/Vite + Typescript project, with Tailwind for styling and MDX for writing posts. 

It is _not_ SEO-optimized, currently renders content client-side (CSR), and is probably the most bare-bones and unoptimized blog you might find on the internet.

Every article is written in an `.mdx` file, and Vite's `import.module.glob()` is helping me to collect every article at build time.

The blog itself is hosted on AWS, with a pretty basic stack too. The domain is on Route53, and the blog is hosted on an S3 bucket with a Cloudfront CDN in front of it.

I also have some funny little workarounds to some of the problems I ran into.

#### MDX Frontmatter

To be honest, I blame MDX's poor documentation for this. MDX's [documentation](https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/) tells you to use the `mdx` plugin from `@mdx-js/rollup`, but it could not extract the markdown frontmatter I needed.

After some frustration with the documentation (the [frontmatter guide](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter) was particularly useless), I decided to write the plugin myself.

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
const mdxPlugin: PluginOption = {
  name: "mdx-plugin",
  enforce: "pre",
  transform(src, id) {
    if (!id.endsWith(".mdx")) {
      return {
        code: src,
        map: null,
      };
    }
    const compiledCode = compileSync(src, {
      remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter],
    });
    const vfile = new VFile({ path: id, value: src });
    matter(vfile);
    const frontMatter = vfile.data.matter as Record<string, any>;

    let code: string =
      compiledCode.value instanceof Uint8Array
        ? compiledCode.value.toString()
        : compiledCode.value;
    code = code.replace(
      "exportÂ default function MDXContent",
      "export function Content"
    );
    code += "\n" + "export const frontmatter = " + JSON.stringify(frontMatter);
    return {
      code,
      map: null,
    };
  },
};
```

Of course, right after I write this, I discover the plugin [`remark-mdx-frontmatter`](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mdx-frontmatter). Too late.

#### Paragraph Override

Another thing I discovered was that MDX loves putting everything in paragraph tags. To support image captions, I decided to override my images with `<figure>` tags, and that gives you this problem:

![Error message: In HTML, figure cannot be a descendant of p. This will cause a hydration error.](./figure-p-descendent-error-message.png)

Of course, the fix is to switch out all `<p>` tags with `<div>` tags.

```typescript
// src/pages/post/mdx-components/P.tsx
export function P(props: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return <div className="mb-3">{props.children}</div>;
}
```

## Conclusion

So that's it about this blog.

I am starting from the most basic stack possible, a client-side SPA React/Vite app, and I plan to implement features that we all know and love most blogs for, such as SSR, some SEO optimizations, a proper Multi-Page Application (MPA) setup, and of course, FCP and bundle size optimizations.

I suppose this blog is a project that serves as its own documentation. I hope to document every feature and optimization I implement, as well as every decision I make along the way. 

I believe in understanding our tools and re-inventing the wheel, and that even when we stand on the shoulder of giants, we must all touch grass from time to time.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I build fun and interesting things.
