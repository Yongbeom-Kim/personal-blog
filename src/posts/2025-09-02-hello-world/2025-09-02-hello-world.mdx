title: Hello World - Welcome to My Technical Blog
date: '2025-09-02'
excerpt: Welcome to my new blog! A quick introduction to what you'll find here, the tech stack powering this site, and some exciting topics I'm planning to explore.

I told myself to start a blog many many times, but it was really only after a friend Karisse started her [own](https://karissekhoo.dev) that I truly found the motivation to build my own little corner of the internet.ments, and learnings from my journey in web development. I intend this to be both a place to share cool things, and a cool project in and as of itself.

## About this Blog

When it comes to software, I'm more of a do-it-myself kinda guy. I'm here to write code, not to play dependency lego, you know? For this reason, I'm starting *this* project with a minimalistic tech stack.

### The Current Stack

This blog is a simple React/Vite + Typescript project, with Tailwind for styling and MDX for writing posts. It is *not* SEO-optimized, currently renders content client-side (CSR), and is probably the most bare-bones and unoptimized blog you might find on the internet.

I am self-hosting it on AWS, with a pretty basic stack as well. The domain is on Route53, and the blog is hosted on an S3 bucket with a Cloudfront CDN in front of it.

## What's Coming Next

I've got some pretty exciting technical topics lined up that I'm genuinely curious to explore and share:

### Event Tracking Deep Dive
I'm planning to implement comprehensive event tracking across the blog and document the entire process. We'll explore different approaches, privacy considerations, and performance implications.

### SSR vs SSG Showdown
Time for some good old-fashioned benchmarking! I want to experiment with Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation approaches, measuring performance with and without event tracking. Expect charts, graphs, and probably some surprising results.

### The Hybrid MPA Strategy
Moving beyond the traditional SPA vs MPA debate, I'm curious about hybrid multi-page application strategies. How can we get the best of both worlds? Let's find out together.

### True MPA with Code Splitting
Finally, I want to explore what a true multi-page application looks like in 2024, complete with intelligent code splitting and modern tooling. Spoiler alert: it might not be what you expect.

## Why This Blog Exists

Honestly? I learn best by building and explaining. There's something about writing down your thoughts that forces you to really understand what you're talking about. Plus, if I can help someone else avoid the rabbit holes I've fallen into, that's a win in my book.

I'm aiming for that sweet spot between technical depth and accessibility - detailed enough to be useful, but conversational enough that you don't need a computer science degree to follow along.

## Let's Build Something Cool

So that's the plan! I'm excited to share this journey with you, whether you're a seasoned developer, just starting out, or somewhere in between. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about web development.

Here's to building cool stuff and sharing what we learn along the way. ðŸš€

*P.S. - Yes, this is a "hello world" post, but I promise the code examples will get more interesting from here!*
