Well, here we are! After countless "I should really start a blog" moments, I've finally pulled the trigger and built this little corner of the internet. Welcome to my technical blog, where I'll be sharing thoughts, experiments, and learnings from my journey in web development.

## What Powers This Blog

Before diving into future content, let me give you a quick tour under the hood. This blog is built with a pretty sweet modern stack that I'm genuinely excited about:

### The Core Stack

- **React 19** with **TypeScript** - Because type safety is life, and React 19's new features are just *chef's kiss*
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development experience that makes webpack feel like dial-up internet
- **React Router DOM 7** - Clean, declarative routing that just works
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling that's converted me from a CSS-in-JS skeptic to a believer
- **MDX** - The perfect marriage of Markdown and React components

### The Architecture Philosophy

I went for a minimalist, content-first approach inspired by Dan Abramov's [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/). The whole thing is essentially a single-page application with clean URLs (`/` and `/posts/[slug]`) and dynamic imports using Vite's `import.meta.glob` for automatic post discovery.

The best part? No build step needed when I add new posts. Just drop an MDX file in the posts folder, and it's automatically picked up. It's like magic, but the kind of magic that actually makes sense when you look at the code.

### Design Decisions

I've implemented a dual-theme system (light and dark) with CSS variables, keeping things ultra-minimal and readable. The color palette is carefully chosen - think linen and rich espresso for light mode, charcoal brown and parchment for dark mode. It's all about that cozy, readable vibe.

## What's Coming Next

I've got some pretty exciting technical topics lined up that I'm genuinely curious to explore and share:

### Event Tracking Deep Dive
I'm planning to implement comprehensive event tracking across the blog and document the entire process. We'll explore different approaches, privacy considerations, and performance implications.

### SSR vs SSG Showdown
Time for some good old-fashioned benchmarking! I want to experiment with Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation approaches, measuring performance with and without event tracking. Expect charts, graphs, and probably some surprising results.

### The Hybrid MPA Strategy
Moving beyond the traditional SPA vs MPA debate, I'm curious about hybrid multi-page application strategies. How can we get the best of both worlds? Let's find out together.

### True MPA with Code Splitting
Finally, I want to explore what a true multi-page application looks like in 2024, complete with intelligent code splitting and modern tooling. Spoiler alert: it might not be what you expect.

## Why This Blog Exists

Honestly? I learn best by building and explaining. There's something about writing down your thoughts that forces you to really understand what you're talking about. Plus, if I can help someone else avoid the rabbit holes I've fallen into, that's a win in my book.

I'm aiming for that sweet spot between technical depth and accessibility - detailed enough to be useful, but conversational enough that you don't need a computer science degree to follow along.

## Let's Build Something Cool

So that's the plan! I'm excited to share this journey with you, whether you're a seasoned developer, just starting out, or somewhere in between. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about web development.

Here's to building cool stuff and sharing what we learn along the way. ðŸš€
